# Android Clean Architecture [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3e9bbcba7b3945f4b9ba0887b8639a00)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

A demo movie android app that demonstrates Clean Architecture and is written in Kotlin.üíØüéû 

### The Motivation behind the app
This repository was created with the intention of stepping outside of my comfort zone as much as possible, tackling topics outside of my area of expertise, and using it to implement new challenges and ideas.

# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer ‚Äî the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.

# Architecture Layers

The application consists of three layers:

The domain layer, the data layer, and the presentation layer.

Looking at project‚Äôs high-level structure, you‚Äôll see that each layer is represented by a module in the project.

I like it because it helps me avoid accidentals ‚Äúleaks‚Äù between the layers.
