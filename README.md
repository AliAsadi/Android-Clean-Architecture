# Android Clean Architecture [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3e9bbcba7b3945f4b9ba0887b8639a00)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

An Android movie app that simulates a real-world project environment, featuring Clean Architecture, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose with Offline-first support.

In addition, the project:
* Is **continually updated** to stay aligned with the latest technologies.
* Is **fully unit-tested**.
* Uses **Detekt** to ensure code quality.
* Leverages **Kover** to generate comprehensive unit test reports.

# Features

1. **Offline-first**: The app can be accessed even without an internet connection.
2. **Pagination**: Efficiently loads large amounts of data to improve the user experience.
3. **Search functionality**: Allows users to quickly find specific information within the app.
4. **Connectivity Status**: Shows a banner to inform users of their connectivity status.
5. **Auto Sync**: Uses both NetworkConnectivityStream and WorkManager to ensure data is always up-to-date.
6. **Favorites**: Users can add movies to a favorites list.
7. **Pull to Refresh**: Allows users to refresh the content by pulling down on the screen.

# Unit Test Coverage

The app is unit-tested and uses Kover to generate detailed coverage reports.

To generate the coverage report, run:

```
./gradlew koverTask
```

This command covers all modules and both main and test sources. You can add this command to your CI pipelines to automatically generate coverage reports with each build. Kover also works well with products like CodeCov for continuous coverage monitoring.

For more details, refer to the [Official Kover documentation](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx-kover/) and the [CodeCov documentation](https://docs.codecov.com/).


## Previous Versions
* To explore the app's earlier **XML-based UI**, check out the [xml_based_app](https://github.com/AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture/tree/xml_based_app
) branch.

* For a basic version of the app **without pagination**, check out the [xml_based_basic_app](https://github.com/AliAsadi/Android-Clean-Architecture/tree/xml_based_basic_app
) branch.


# Variants

The project has two variants: **production** and **mock**.

1. **Mock Variant:** Fetches generated mock data.

2. **Production Variant:** Calls the production API.

Each variant has a distinct `MovieRemoteDataSource` implementation, ensuring that in the mock variant, data is generated, while in the production variant, the actual API is called.

## The Motivation behind the app
This repository was created with the intention of sharing knowledge and using it to implement new challenges and ideas.

## Movies Mock Server API

**API:** [Movies Mock Server](https://movies-mock-server.vercel.app/)

This API is the primary data source for the app, providing a mock database of movie information. It is designed to mimic real-world data operations including fetching, updating, and managing movie data.

**API Repository:** [Movies Mock Server Repository](https://github.com/AliAsadi/movies-mock-server)

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the Movies Mock Server API

## üí° Architectural Insights
Architecture by its nature is **dynamic** and **ever-evolving**, there are always several solutions to every problem, and what works best will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.

# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer ‚Äî the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.

# Architecture Layers

The application consists of three layers:

The domain layer, the data layer, and the presentation layer.

Looking at project‚Äôs high-level structure, you‚Äôll see that each layer is represented by a module in the project.

I like it because it helps me avoid accidentals ‚Äúleaks‚Äù between the layers.
